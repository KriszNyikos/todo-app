### Some tech boundaries:
- I would like the application to be written in VanillaJavascript.
- I would like to ask You kindly not to use any libraries.
- I would like You to save the data of the application to the localStorage, so when we 
refresh the page the data is not lost.
Should You have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask them.
